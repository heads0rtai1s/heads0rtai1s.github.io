      <description>The first four months of 2020 have been dominated by the Coronavirus pandemic (aka COVID-19), which has transformed global life in an unprecedented way. Societies and economies struggle to adapt to the new conditions and necessary contraints. A reassuringly large fraction of governments around the world continue to take evidence-based approaches to this crisis that are grounded in large scale data collection efforts. Most of this data is being made publicly available and can be studied in real time.</description>

      <title>R Shiny for beginners: annotated starter code</title>

      <description>This week I decided to get started with the R shiny package for interactive web applications. As an absolute beginner, I want to document my learning journey in the hope that it will be useful for other first-time shiny users.
This post assumes some basic familiarity with R and the tidyverse, but no prior knowledge of shiny is required. The content is digested from the official shiny tutorial which is great and definitely worth checking out for more details.</description>

      <title>Tidyverse evolutions: curly-curly operator and pivoting (feat. tidytuesday data &amp; leaflet visuals)</title>

      <description>The tidyverse ecosystem is steadily growing and adapting to the needs of its users. As part of this evolution, existing tools are being replaced by new and better methods. As useful as this flexibility is to the strength of the system, sometimes it can be hard to keep track of all the changes. This blogpost will deal with two new developments: the ‘curly-curly’ operator for tidy evaluation and the new ‘pivot’ functions for data reshaping.</description>

      <title>Tidy evaluation in R: Part 2 - Complex use cases (feat. facet zoom)</title>

      <description>In an earlier post I gave a gentle introduction to tidy evaluation in the R tidyverse using simple examples. I covered quoting with enquo and unquoting with !! in brief dplyr and ggplot2 snippets. Today, I aim to build a collection of more complex use cases involving additional tools.
Those are our libraries:
libs &amp;lt;- c(&amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;stringr&amp;#39;, # wrangling &amp;#39;knitr&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;kableExtra&amp;#39;, # table styling &amp;#39;ggplot2&amp;#39;,&amp;#39;ggforce&amp;#39;) # plots invisible(lapply(libs, library, character.</description>

      <title>Data flow visuals - alluvial vs ggalluvial in R</title>
      <link>/2019/06/06/visuals-alluvial-ggalluvial/</link>

      <description>I have long been a fan of creative data visualisation techniques. For me, the choice of visual representation is driven by both the type of data and the kind of question one wants to examine.
The power of its visualisation tools has been a major strength of the R language well before the ggplot2 package and the tidyverse burst onto the scene. Today’s post will be an introductory examination of two similar packages that allow us to study the connection and flow of data between different categorical features via alluvial plots.</description>
