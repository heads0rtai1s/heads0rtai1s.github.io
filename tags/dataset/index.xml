      <description>It’s summer, and the long-awaited Rstudio conference for 2022 is only days away. Next week, a large number of R aficionados will gather in Washington DC for the first time in person since the beginning of the pandemic. A pandemic, mind you, that is far from over. But Covid precautions are in place, and I trust the R community more than most to be responsible and thoughtful. With masks, social distance, and outdoor events: I’m excited to meet new people and see again many familiar faces from my first Rstudio conference in 2020.</description>

      <description>The first four months of 2020 have been dominated by the Coronavirus pandemic (aka COVID-19), which has transformed global life in an unprecedented way. Societies and economies struggle to adapt to the new conditions and necessary contraints. A reassuringly large fraction of governments around the world continue to take evidence-based approaches to this crisis that are grounded in large scale data collection efforts. Most of this data is being made publicly available and can be studied in real time.</description>
