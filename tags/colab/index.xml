      <description>At the beginning of last year, I got the motivation from other people’s Twitter posts to set and track my own goals for what would surely be the year we would emerge from the shadows of the pandemic.

My first choice options GCP and AWS quickly turned out to require quota increases which either didn’t happen or took too long.</description>
