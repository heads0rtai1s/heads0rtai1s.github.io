      <description>This is a short post on how to count your followers on Kaggle, and who the current Kagglers are with the largest following. It also serves as preparation for my next blog post in which I will practice some network analysis on the table that weâ€™ll create in this post.
Kaggle, true to form as the home of data science and machine learning on the internet, provides a lot of information on the activity of the community in the appropriately named Meta Kaggle dataset.</description>
