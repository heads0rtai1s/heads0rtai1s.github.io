      <description>It is the day after rstudio::conf(2022), and I’m sitting in the lobby of the ridiculously oversized conference hotel, trying to collect my thoughts and impressions. It was a densely packed two days of presentation and events (plus the earlier two days of workshops). Lots of new inspirations, ideas, impressions; all of which takes a little time to digest.
And of course there was the community experience, after two years of pandemic.</description>

      <description>It’s summer, and the long-awaited Rstudio conference for 2022 is only days away. Next week, a large number of R aficionados will gather in Washington DC for the first time in person since the beginning of the pandemic. A pandemic, mind you, that is far from over. But Covid precautions are in place, and I trust the R community more than most to be responsible and thoughtful. With masks, social distance, and outdoor events: I’m excited to meet new people and see again many familiar faces from my first Rstudio conference in 2020.</description>

      <description>My Kaggle Hidden Gems Notebooks competition officially concluded on May 17th. A number of great notebooks were being submitted, and I wanted to design a nice leaderboard to announce the final scores and winners. When I discovered the new gtExtras package, I instantly knew that it would be the perfect tool for this task. Let me show you how.
The goal of the Hidden Gems competition was to build insightful and engaging notebooks, in R or Python, exploring aspect of my Hidden Gems dataset on Kaggle, which chronicles 100 episodes of me highlighting underrated notebooks published by Kagglers.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, the Kaggle community crossed the amazing milestone of 10 million registered users! In celebration, I’ve put together a forum post that visualises the accelerated growth over the years. Here I show the R code behind those plots and talk a bit about my visualisation choices.
For this post, we’ll need a small set of fundamental libraries:
libs &amp;lt;- c(&amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;readr&amp;#39;, # wrangling &amp;#39;lubridate&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;ggrepel&amp;#39;, # datetime, plots &amp;#39;ggthemes&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;ggplot2&amp;#39;) # plots invisible(lapply(libs, library, character.</description>

      <description>This week, the Kaggle Hidden Gems Competition is featured in a special crossover event with the fantastic TidyTuesday project to further strengthen the connections between the R &amp;amp; Kaggle communities. The TidyTuesday participants are invited to expand their beautifully crafted data visuals into narrative notebooks on the Kaggle platform, and receive feedback and prizes for their work. This post will briefly describe my goals and motivation for this collaboration, and then show the code for one of my own visuals where I learned how to include images in ggplot2 barplots.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I launched my first very own competition on the Kaggle platform, the goal of which is to design engaging data science notebooks with great visuals, narration, and insights. Today, at the half-way point of the competition, I want to write about my motivations for creating this challenge, the underlying data, and my criteria of what makes a captivating and accessible notebook in the R or Python languages.</description>

      <title>Analysing tweets with the rtweet package</title>

      <description>This is a brief post on collecting and analysing tweets. I will show how to use the rtweet package to extract Twitter posts about the R community. This ties into last weeks post on rstudio::conf and community values, and is also related to my previous intro post on web scraping.
First, we load rtweet and other (tidyverse) packages we will need:
libs &amp;lt;- c(&amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;tibble&amp;#39;, # wrangling &amp;#39;stringr&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;rtweet&amp;#39;, # strings, tweets &amp;#39;knitr&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;kableExtra&amp;#39;, # table styling &amp;#39;lubridate&amp;#39;, # time &amp;#39;ggplot2&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;ggthemes&amp;#39;) # plots invisible(lapply(libs, library, character.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I was fortunate to attend my very first Rstudio conference. Spoiler: it was an amazing event - packed to the brim with new ideas, tools, impressions, and most important of all: smart and kind people. This was the first time that San Francisco was hosting “rstudio::conf” (the affectionate shorthand is mirroring R’s package::tool syntax). Having moved to the Bay Area not long ago I really counted myself lucky to have such a promising event in my neighbourhood.</description>

      <title>What makes a community great?</title>
      <link>https://heads0rtai1s.github.io/2019/04/19/great-community-kaggledays19/</link>

      <description>The easy answer to this question is: the people. Great people build great communities. Case not quite closed yet, though, because there is more to it. Even the most promising group of individuals needs certain conditions in order to grow into a strong and thriving community. The kind of community that lifts up its members beyond their individual capabilities and becomes more than the sum of their proverbial skills and contributions.</description>
