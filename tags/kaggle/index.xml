      <description>In the final, hectic days of a recent Kaggle competition I found myself in want of more GPU power. As one often does in such an occasion. My own laptop, with its GPU setup, was doing a fine job with various small models and small images, but scaling up both aspects became necessary to climb the leaderboard further. My first choice options GCP and AWS quickly turned out to require quota increases which either didnâ€™t happen or took too long.</description>

      <description>The easy answer to this question is: the people. Great people build great communities. Case not quite closed yet, though, because there is more to it.
