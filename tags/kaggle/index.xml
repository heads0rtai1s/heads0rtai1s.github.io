      <description>It’s summer, and the long-awaited Rstudio conference for 2022 is only days away. Next week, a large number of R aficionados will gather in Washington DC for the first time in person since the beginning of the pandemic. A pandemic, mind you, that is far from over. But Covid precautions are in place, and I trust the R community more than most to be responsible and thoughtful. With masks, social distance, and outdoor events: I’m excited to meet new people and see again many familiar faces from my first Rstudio conference in 2020.</description>

      <description>My Kaggle Hidden Gems Notebooks competition officially concluded on May 17th. A number of great notebooks were being submitted, and I wanted to design a nice leaderboard to announce the final scores and winners. When I discovered the new gtExtras package, I instantly knew that it would be the perfect tool for this task. Let me show you how.
The goal of the Hidden Gems competition was to build insightful and engaging notebooks, in R or Python, exploring aspect of my Hidden Gems dataset on Kaggle, which chronicles 100 episodes of me highlighting underrated notebooks published by Kagglers.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, the Kaggle community crossed the amazing milestone of 10 million registered users! In celebration, I’ve put together a forum post that visualises the accelerated growth over the years. Here I show the R code behind those plots and talk a bit about my visualisation choices.
For this post, we’ll need a small set of fundamental libraries:
libs &amp;lt;- c(&amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;readr&amp;#39;, # wrangling &amp;#39;lubridate&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;ggrepel&amp;#39;, # datetime, plots &amp;#39;ggthemes&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;ggplot2&amp;#39;) # plots invisible(lapply(libs, library, character.</description>

      <description>This week, the Kaggle Hidden Gems Competition is featured in a special crossover event with the fantastic TidyTuesday project to further strengthen the connections between the R &amp;amp; Kaggle communities. The TidyTuesday participants are invited to expand their beautifully crafted data visuals into narrative notebooks on the Kaggle platform, and receive feedback and prizes for their work. This post will briefly describe my goals and motivation for this collaboration, and then show the code for one of my own visuals where I learned how to include images in ggplot2 barplots.</description>

      <description>Two weeks ago, I launched my first very own competition on the Kaggle platform, the goal of which is to design engaging data science notebooks with great visuals, narration, and insights. Today, at the half-way point of the competition, I want to write about my motivations for creating this challenge, the underlying data, and my criteria of what makes a captivating and accessible notebook in the R or Python languages.</description>

      <description>Last week, I was spontaneously invited to contribute a live-coding exploratory data analysis (EDA) to a recently launched Kaggle community competition. I accepted the invite, and 24h later we were live-streaming my first encounter with the data on YouTube. Here are my reflections on this experience and on my EDA process in general.
The context The Kaggle platform, my favourite machine learning (ML) and data science (DS) community, recently made it much easier for Kagglers to host their own competitions.</description>

      <description>This is the second part in a series of posts about setting and tracking my yearly goals when it comes to Machine Learning &amp;amp; Data Science (ML &amp;amp; DS) as well as Sports &amp;amp; Exercise. In the first post I wrote about my past goals for 2021 and the lessons learned from those. This post will focus on my goals and expectations for 2022, and how last year’s experiences shaped and informed them.</description>

      <description>At the beginning of last year, I got the motivation from other people’s Twitter posts to set and track my own goals for what would surely be the year we would emerge from the shadows of the pandemic. With an ever so slightly more jaded outlook to life, I’m doing the same this year. On a global level, many societies didn’t seem to have learned an aweful lot from the Covid years of 2020 and 2021.</description>

      <description>In the final, hectic days of a recent Kaggle competition I found myself in want of more GPU power. As one often does in such an occasion. My own laptop, with its GPU setup, was doing a fine job with various small models and small images, but scaling up both aspects became necessary to climb the leaderboard further. My first choice options GCP and AWS quickly turned out to require quota increases which either didn’t happen or took too long.</description>

      <description>The first four months of 2020 have been dominated by the Coronavirus pandemic (aka COVID-19), which has transformed global life in an unprecedented way. Societies and economies struggle to adapt to the new conditions and necessary contraints. A reassuringly large fraction of governments around the world continue to take evidence-based approaches to this crisis that are grounded in large scale data collection efforts. Most of this data is being made publicly available and can be studied in real time.</description>

      <title>What makes a community great?</title>

      <description>The easy answer to this question is: the people. Great people build great communities. Case not quite closed yet, though, because there is more to it. Even the most promising group of individuals needs certain conditions in order to grow into a strong and thriving community. The kind of community that lifts up its members beyond their individual capabilities and becomes more than the sum of their proverbial skills and contributions.</description>
